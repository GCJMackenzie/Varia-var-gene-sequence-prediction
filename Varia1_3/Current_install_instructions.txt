1. Download Varia
2. unzip in directory you want to install Varia in
3. enter Varia1_3 directory
4. run Install_proto.sh, this will:
	check if Varia can find blastn, either stating the path to the version it will use or tell the user to intall blastn
	check if Varia can find samtools either stating the path to the version it will use or telling the user to install samtools
	check if Varia can find mcl, if it cant it will ask if the user wants to automatically install it with conda. If it can find mcl, then it will print the path to the version it will use
	check if Varia can find circos, if it cant it will ask if the user wants to automatically install it with conda. If it can find circos, then it will print the path to the version it will use
	check if Varia can find makeblastdb, either stating the path to the version it will use or tell the user to intall makeblastdb
	check if Varia can find megablast, either stating the path to the version it will use or tell the user to intall megablast
	check if Varia can find formatdb, either stating the path to the version it will use or tell the user to intall formatdb
	check that there is a database registered in the correct format for megablast and blast_n and will ask user which file to use if there isn't one.
	check that there is a domain file registered and will ask the user to select one if there isn't
	report the PATH to Varia1_2 that the user should add to their PATH
	Generate a log file summarising the installation

notes: 
-Varia.sh currently uses megablast, so ensuring megablast and formatdb are installed is essential. 
-Varia_n.sh is a (currently out of date) legacy version set up to use the blast_n version of megablast. so Varia.sh does not require makeblastdb or blastn to run, Varia_n.sh would though.

-The database included with Varia is an example database. The Pf3k database could not be included with Varia in part due to publication status and in part due to size of the database. It is recommended to download the Pf3K database of var genes for use with Varia.

-Varia creates soft links to databases and domain files. This is so the names of the files are correct for the Varia scripts to use, whilst ensuring the original files are not changed and don't need to be copied.

-To set the database for vardb and megavardb, type yes when prompted then enter the full path to the fasta file containing the database you wish to use. eg. home/users/databases/Pf3k_var_genes.fasta.
-the domains file in the domains directory of Varia1_3 should be fine for use with P.flaciparum, when asked to selct a domains file say yes. Then enter name of file as: varDB.version2.subdomains.txt.
-Alternatives domains can be used but will require the path to their directory to be entered before their filename. eg. /home/user/domains/alternative_domains.fasta.

-there is a known issue with Circos and certain versions of perl. Circos will work on version 5.22.0 and earlier. Some more recent versions may not install Circos corectly due to a perl module not being updated correctly. Varia can run without Circos but will not be able to make plots. So it is recommended to use perl 5.22.0 if possible.

5. Add the Varia1_3 directory to your PATH
